multi-player airplane game
================

description
----------------

A multi player combat airplane game implemented in node.js. A live demo of the current functionality is deployed on a windows azure website [here](http://garagehackers.azurewebsites.net).

This project was developed during the windows/node [hackathon](https://msopentech.com/nodehackathon2013).

Current functionality:

- pitch manipulation - left and right arrow keys change the airplanes pitch.
- position changes based on time and pitch.
- the flight path wraps around if the plane goes outside of the canvas area.

todo
----------------

- improve physics model (gravity, lift, drag, thrust ...)
- add collision detection
- implement weapons systems :)
- add multiple players (computer opponent AI?)
- add background objects (e.g. clouds, trees)
